import { FileTree, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. Install [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate), if you haven't already

2. Generate a new React-Plug plugin.

   ```sh
   cargo generate gh:exa04/react-plug-template
   ```

</Steps>

Now, you have a new plugin with - roughly - the following file structure:

<FileTree>

- gui/ GUI code
  - src/
    - bindings/ Auto-generated TS bindings
    - App.tsx
    - ...
  - package.json
  - ...
- src/ Plugin code
  - lib.rs
  - params.rs
- xtask/
- Cargo.toml

</FileTree>

You can build and bundle your plugin with:

```sh
cargo xtask bundle <your-plugin>
```

This will bundle your plugin to `target/bundled/<your-plugin>`. You can now load this plugin in your DAW.

ðŸŽ‰ That's it! You're ready to start developing your plugin!
