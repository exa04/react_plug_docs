This framework is still very early in development. Some breaking changes might
still be to come. Definitely do not use it in production!

## Overview

React-Plug is a crate that allows you to build Rust audio plugins with React
GUIs. It offers the most simple and batteries-included way of creating VST3 /
CLAP plugins with a web UI. It renders your React code through your operating
system's built-in WebView, bundles and includes it, automagically handles
plugin-to-GUI communication, and more.

React-Plug is based on [`nih-plug-webview`](https://github.com/httnn/nih-plug-webview) and works on top of [`nih-plug`](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug).

        Once you define your plugin's parameters in Rust, they're automatically
        available inside your GUI as typed objects.

    <Card title="Custom IPC Messages" icon="comment">
        Define your IPC messages once in your Rust code, and then handle and
        send
        them from both your GUI and plugin code.
